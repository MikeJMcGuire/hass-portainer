Portainer CE v2.x Add-On for Home Assistant (https://blog.mikejmcguire.com/2021/02/17/portainer-ce-2-1-add-on-for-home-assistant/)

This add-on provides a 2.x version of Portainer-CE, as the standard add-on is based on Portainer 1.x.

The initial credentials for the add-on are admin/portainer - strongly suggest changing the password upon first login.

Port options are available for exposing ports 8000 and 9000 as required.

Portainer requires Home Assistant protection mode to be disabled, as it requires administrative access to the docker platform. As a result, care must be taken when using the portainer tool.
